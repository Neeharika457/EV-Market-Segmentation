India’s EV market is projected to grow significantly, with 2-wheelers dominating (~80% of sales) due to affordability and urban mobility needs. The FAME II scheme and state-level incentives have accelerated adoption, particularly in urban areas. Understanding segment preferences is critical for tailoring products and strategies.

Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) : Used to track growth over time

CAGR = (Ending or max value)/ (Beginning or min value) ** (1/ years) - 1

Penetration Rate: Used to measure market share or adoption level at a point of time

Penetration Rate (%) = (EV Sales/ Total Vehicle Sales) * 100

The above two are calculated to check the growth and sales rate overtime.


## Battery Life Prediction

A neural network model predicts battery life using:

Features: `type_discharge` (charge/discharge), `Capacity`, `Re`, `Rct`.

Performance: Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4449.05.

Example Predictions:

- Discharge, Capacity=1.674305, Re=-4.976500e+11, Rct=1.055903e+12 → 26.15 units.

- Charge, Capacity=20.5, Re=-2.983215e+11, Rct=1.223456e+12 → 340.93 units.

##  Market Segmentation:

### Demographic Segmentation

Age: Young professionals (18–35 years) favor 2-wheelers for affordability. Families (35–50 years) prefer 4-wheelers for safety.

Income: Middle-income (INR 5–15 lakh annually) dominates 2-wheeler purchases; high-income (INR 15 lakh+) prefers 4-wheelers.

Occupation: Urban professionals and small business owners adopt EVs for fuel savings.


Young Professionals - Age 18–35, middle-income, prefer 2-wheelers, tech-savvy.

Families - Age 35–50, high-income, prefer 4-wheelers, value safety.

Small Businesses - Delivery/transport sectors, cost-driven, prefer 3-wheelers.


### Geographic Segmentation

Urban Areas: Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi lead due to charging infrastructure.

Rural Areas: Low adoption due to limited infrastructure.

Regional Trends: Southern/western states show faster growth.

Urban (e.g., Maharashtra, Delhi) - High adoption, 2-wheelers dominant, robust infrastructure.

Rural - Low adoption, limited infrastructure, prefer low-cost 2-wheelers.

Southern/Western States - Rapid growth, supportive policies, mixed vehicle types.


### Psychographic Segmentation

Environmentally Conscious: Prioritize low emissions.

Tech Enthusiasts: Seek smart features (e.g., connectivity).

Cost-Conscious: Focus on affordability, prefer 2-wheelers.


Eco-Conscious - Low emissions, efficient batteries.

Tech Enthusiasts - Connectivity, range, performance.

Cost-Conscious - Affordability, prefer 2-wheelers.


### Behavioural Segmentation

Purchase Patterns: First-time buyers prefer established brands (e.g., Tata). Repeat buyers explore new entrants.

Usage Patterns: Commuters favor 2-wheelers; commercial users choose 3-wheelers/4-wheelers.

Loyalty: Moderate, driven by price/performance.

First-Time Buyers - Prefer established brands, focus on reliability.

Commercial User - High usage, prefer 3-wheelers/4-wheelers, cost-driven.

Repeat Buyers - Open to new brands, prioritize performance.
